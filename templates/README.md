## How to Use

1. Open any template markdown file for a detailed blueprint: layout structure, content hierarchy, color/typography recommendations, interaction ideas, and resource stack.  
2. Pair the template with the corresponding guidance in `UX-UI-Design-Resource.md` for deeper best practices.  
3. Mix and match components across categories—the structure is modular so you can reuse hero blocks, feature grids, and dashboards.

Each template references open-source tools (Pico.css, Tabler Icons, Lucide, Animate.css, Every Layout, etc.) so you can implement quickly without licensing friction.
